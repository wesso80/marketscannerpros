# Market Scanner Application

## Overview
A multi-platform market scanning application that analyzes equity and cryptocurrency markets using technical indicators and risk management. It fetches real-time data, performs technical analysis, and provides ATR-based position sizing. The application includes a web dashboard, automated notifications, and a comprehensive trade journal. It is distributed as a Progressive Web App (PWA), Android TWA, and Capacitor-based native iOS/Android apps, targeting both mobile and web platforms for broad accessibility.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Recent Changes

### Bug Fixes (October 2025)
- **Authentication Security**: Added try-catch blocks around JSON parsing in auth system to prevent crashes from malformed tokens
- **Production Safety**: Removed unsafe runtime package installation; packages must be pre-installed
- **Email Configuration**: Improved fallback logic for API keys with safer Streamlit secrets handling
- **Error Handling**: Replaced broad exception handling with specific exception types for better debugging
- **Configuration Management**: Removed hardcoded domains and URLs; now using environment variables:
  - `COOKIE_DOMAIN` for cookie domain configuration
  - `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` for CORS allowed origins
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` for app URL (required)
- **Mobile Detection**: Fixed redundant mobile detection logic; now uses single source of truth from session state
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unused functions and improved code organization
- **Free Access Model**: Converted entire app to free access - all features unlocked for everyone
  - Removed paid tier restrictions
  - All features (alerts, charts, backtesting, trade journal) now available without subscription
- **Deployment Configuration Fix**: Resolved Node.js detection issue
  - Moved `package.json` and Next.js config files to `nextjs-web/` subdirectory
  - Prevents deployment system from incorrectly treating Python Streamlit app as Node.js project
  - Main deployment now correctly identified as Python/Streamlit application

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Streamlit Dashboard**: Interactive web-based interface.
- **Plotly Integration**: Advanced charting for technical analysis visualization.

- **Error Monitoring**: Sentry integration for real-time error tracking and performance monitoring.
- **Rate Limiting**: In-memory rate limiter (60 requests/min, 1000 requests/hour per user).
- **Database Connection Pooling**: `psycopg2` pool with health checks and retry logic.
- **Automated Backups**: Daily PostgreSQL backups with `pg_dump` and 7-day retention.
- **Health Check Endpoint**: For monitoring services.
- **Code Quality**: Extensive type hinting and LSP error resolution for improved maintainability.

### System Design Choices
- **Multi-Platform Strategy**: PWA, Android TWA, and Capacitor for comprehensive mobile and web distribution.
- **Secure Configuration**: Environment variables for sensitive credentials.
- **Data Persistence**: CSV export and PostgreSQL for trade journal.
- **Scalability**: Designed with production features like rate limiting, connection pooling, and error monitoring.
- **Legal Compliance**: Integrated legal documentation (Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Refund Policy, Cookie Policy) addressing trial policies, data collection, and platform-specific guidelines.
