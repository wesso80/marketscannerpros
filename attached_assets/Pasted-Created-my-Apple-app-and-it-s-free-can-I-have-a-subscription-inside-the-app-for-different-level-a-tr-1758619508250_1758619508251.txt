Created my Apple app and it’s free can I have a subscription inside the app for different level a trading

Yes—you absolutely can. Make the app free to download and sell access to your premium trading features as auto-renewable in-app subscription(s). Apple explicitly allows subscriptions in any app category, so long as you use In-App Purchase (StoreKit) for digital features and follow the subscription rules.

Here’s the clean way to set it up for “Basic / Pro / Elite”-style tiers:

Design your subscription structure

Create one Subscription Group in App Store Connect (e.g., “Market Scanner Pro”).

Add multiple subscriptions inside that group (e.g., Basic, Pro, Elite) and assign Levels so users can upgrade/downgrade/cross-grade properly (Level 1 = most features). Pick durations like monthly / yearly.

App Store Connect settings (per product)

Set price + duration (1 week / 1, 2, 3, 6 months / 1 year), localize the display name/description, optionally add free trials or intro offers, and consider grace period and price-increase consent if you plan to change prices.

Implementation in your app

Use StoreKit (or a RN/Expo bridge like react-native-iap / RevenueCat) to:
• fetch available products → show your paywall,
• initiate purchase → unlock entitlement on success,
• expose a “Manage Subscription” link in-app so users can view/change/cancel (Apple requires an obvious management path).

Server-side verification (recommended)

Validate receipts and entitlements on your backend and/or with App Store Server API / Notifications so access remains correct across devices and reinstalls. (This also protects you from local spoofing and lets you react to renewals, refunds, or expirations.)

What you must not do

Don’t use external payment for digital features; Apple reviews reject that. (There are niche exceptions like “reader apps,” but trading features are digital services and must use IAP.)

Trading/crypto specifics to avoid review issues

If your app facilitates crypto exchange or transfers, that’s allowed only when the provider is approved/licensed in each region served; otherwise keep it to analytics, education, alerts, charts, etc. Include clear risk disclosures and avoid promising returns.

Mini-checklist for submission

Paywall with clear price, billing period, and trial terms.

Privacy Policy + Terms/EULA linked in the app and on the store listing.

A visible Manage Subscription path in-app.

Feature gating tied to the verified entitlement (don’t unlock based on just a button tap).

If you want, I can outline the exact App Store Connect clicks and a minimal code flow for your Expo/React Native build (product IDs, paywall copy, restore purchases button, and a test plan with Sandbox TestFlight).
