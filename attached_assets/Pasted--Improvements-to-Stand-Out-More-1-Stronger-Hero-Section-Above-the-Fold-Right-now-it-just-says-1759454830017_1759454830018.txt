🚀 Improvements to Stand Out More

1. Stronger Hero Section (Above the Fold)

Right now it just says “MarketScanner Pros — Run smart scans, interpret scores, and manage alerts”.
That’s good, but traders need something punchier. Suggestion:

“Find Breakouts Before They Happen 🚀 — Scan crypto & stocks across timeframes in seconds.”

	•	Add a subheading like: “Trusted by traders who want speed, clarity, and confluence without noise.”
	•	Consider a moving GIF/video demo instead of static screenshot (people love to see it in action).

2. Social Proof & Trust
	•	Add a section of testimonials (even if it’s just you + beta testers at first). Example:
“I spotted XRP’s squeeze 3 hours early thanks to MarketScanner Pro” — Beta user
	•	Add logos of places your app has been mentioned (Reddit, IndieHackers, ProductHunt — even “Coming soon on App Store/Play Store”).
	•	A Trust disclaimer box: “No ads. No spam. Cancel anytime.”

3. Benefits Over Features

Right now you list features. Flip it into outcomes traders care about:
	•	“Never miss a squeeze again.”
	•	“Cut hours of chart-watching into minutes.”
	•	“Focus only on high-probability setups.”

⸻

4. Clearer Call-to-Actions (CTAs)
	•	Add a CTA between sections (not just top + pricing). Example:
“👉 Start scanning now — it’s free.”
	•	Buttons: instead of just “Launch App”, try “Start Free Now” (conversion tends to be higher).

5. Add a Visual “How It Works” Section

Break down in 3 simple steps with icons:
	1.	Pick your symbols
	2.	Run the scan
	3.	Get confluence score + alerts

This helps new visitors immediately “get it”.

⸻

6. Educational / Blog Section
	•	Add a “Trading Insights” blog tab with SEO-rich articles (e.g. “What is a short squeeze?”, “Best free crypto screeners 2025”).
	•	Each post links back to your app → boosts search rankings and credibility.

⸻

7. Future-Growth Tweaks
	•	Add a referral banner: “Invite a friend → both get 7 days free Pro.”
	•	Add email capture form for a free “Daily Scanner Digest” (even if automated from your own scans).
