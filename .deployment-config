# Deployment Configuration for Replit

# This is a Python Streamlit application
# Main entry point: app.py
# Run command: streamlit run app.py --server.port 5000 --server.address 0.0.0.0

# The package.json and Next.js files have been moved to nextjs-web/
# to prevent deployment detection issues. This ensures the deployment
# system correctly identifies this as a Python project.

# For Python deployments, the system should:
# 1. Install dependencies from pyproject.toml and uv.lock
# 2. Use Python 3.11 environment
# 3. Run Streamlit on port 5000
