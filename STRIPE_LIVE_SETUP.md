  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
  className="btn"

## **What Happens Next**

When a real customer pays:
1. They complete checkout ($4.99/month charged)
2. You get **email from Stripe** with their info
3. You **upgrade them** using GRANTING_ACCESS.md guide (2 minutes)
4. Customer gets full access

## **Important: Environment Variables**

Make sure these are set in Vercel (already done):
- âœ… `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_PAYMENTS` = `true`
- âœ… `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = `sk_live_...` (not sk_test_)

Check: https://vercel.com/your-project/settings/environment-variables

## **Testing Before Going Live**

Want to test the live link before real customers?
1. Use link in incognito mode
2. Use test card won't work in live mode
3. Use real card, then refund yourself in Stripe
