      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        MarketScanner Pros ("we", "us", "our") uses cookies and similar tracking technologies to 
        provide, secure, and improve our services. This Cookie Policy explains what these technologies 
        are, how we use them, and your choices.
      </p>

      <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small text files stored on your device (computer, phone, or tablet) when you visit 
        a website. They help websites remember your preferences, authenticate your identity, and track 
        usage patterns.
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies We Use</h2>

      <h3>1. Essential Cookies (Required)</h3>

      </ul>

      <h3>2. Fraud Prevention & Trial Tracking</h3>
      <p>These cookies help prevent abuse and trial fraud:</p>

        <li><strong>Usage Analytics:</strong> Tracks feature usage to prioritize improvements (anonymized).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Your Choices</h2>

      <h3>Browser Controls</h3>
      <p>
        Most browsers let you control cookies through settings. You can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Block all cookies (may break essential App functionality)</li>
        <li>Delete existing cookies</li>
        <li>Block third-party cookies only</li>
        <li>Set cookies to delete when you close your browser</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Blocking essential cookies will prevent the App from working properly, including authentication, subscription access, and data persistence.</p>

      <h3>Do Not Track (DNT)</h3>
      <p>
        We currently do not respond to "Do Not Track" browser signals because there is no universal 
        standard for how to interpret them. However, you can control tracking through your browser settings.
      </p>

      <h3>Opt-Out Options</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> You can disable analytics cookies in your browser settings (essential cookies remain).</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Cookies:</strong> Configure your browser to block third-party cookies from Stripe, Sentry, etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Mobile Apps</h2>
      <p>

        storage. You can manage these through your device settings:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Settings â†’ Privacy & Security â†’ Tracking</li>
        <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings â†’ Privacy â†’ Ads â†’ Delete advertising ID</li>
