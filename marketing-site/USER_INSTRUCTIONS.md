## Best Practices

### For Beginners
1. **Start Small**: Begin with 1% risk per trade until you're comfortable
2. **Diversify**: Don't put all your money in one investment
3. **Use Alerts**: Set price alerts instead of watching charts all day
4. **Follow the Scores**: Focus on investments with scores above 50
5. **Respect Stop Losses**: Use the calculated stop prices to limit losses

### For Advanced Users
1. **Combine Timeframes**: Use daily charts for trends, hourly for entries
2. **Watch Volume**: High volume confirms price movements
3. **Monitor Market Regime**: Bullish trends (price above EMA200) are safer
4. **Use Position Sizing**: Always use the calculated position sizes
5. **Review Performance**: Download CSV results to track your success

### Risk Management
1. **Never Risk More Than You Can Afford**: The 1% rule is there for a reason
2. **Use Stop Losses**: Always set stops at the calculated levels
3. **Don't Chase**: If you miss an opportunity, wait for the next one
4. **Stay Disciplined**: Follow your plan, don't trade emotionally
