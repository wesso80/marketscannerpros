# ✅ Payment Flow Fixed!

## 🔧 What Was Broken:

After checkout, the flow was:
1. User completes Stripe payment ✓
2. Redirected to `/after-checkout` ✓
3. Page tries to call `/api/stripe/confirm` ❌ **→ 404 NOT FOUND**
4. Error → redirects back to `/pricing` ❌

**Result**: User ends up back at pricing page instead of the app.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed:

### 1. Created `/api/stripe/confirm` Endpoint
**File**: `app/api/stripe/confirm/route.ts`

**What it does:**
- Retrieves Stripe checkout session
- Verifies payment was completed
- Updates database with subscription details
- Sets workspace cookie for authentication
- Returns success response

### 2. Updated Redirect to Streamlit App
**File**: `app/after-checkout/page.tsx`

**Changed:**
```typescript
// Before: redirected to /dashboard (doesn't exist)
router.replace("/dashboard");

// After: redirects to Streamlit app
window.location.href = streamlitUrl; // https://app.marketscannerpros.app
```

## 🎯 New Flow (Fixed):

1. **User clicks "Upgrade to Pro Trader"**
   - Pricing page → Creates checkout session

2. **Stripe Checkout**
   - User enters payment info
   - Test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`

3. **After Payment Success**
   - Redirects to: `/after-checkout?session_id=cs_test_...`

4. **Confirmation Page**
   - Shows: "Finishing up… We're applying your Pro features"
   - Calls: `/api/stripe/confirm?session_id=...`

5. **API Confirms Payment**
   - ✅ Retrieves session from Stripe
   - ✅ Verifies payment completed
   - ✅ Updates database (subscription + customer records)
   - ✅ Sets workspace cookie
   - ✅ Returns success

6. **Redirects to Streamlit App**
   - ✅ Opens: `https://app.marketscannerpros.app`
   - ✅ Cookie is set, user is authenticated
   - ✅ User sees their Pro Trader tier activated!

## 📊 What Happens in the Database:

After successful payment, these tables are updated:

### `billing_customers` table:
```sql
INSERT INTO billing_customers (workspace_id, stripe_customer_id)
VALUES ('user-workspace-id', 'cus_...')
```

### `subscriptions` table:
```sql
INSERT INTO subscriptions 
(workspace_id, tier, status, current_period_end, stripe_subscription_id)
VALUES 
('user-workspace-id', 'pro_trader', 'active', '2025-11-12', 'sub_...')
```

---

## 🍪 Cookie Authentication:

After confirmation, a signed cookie is set:

```
workspace_id=workspace-123:signature-hash

Properties:
- httpOnly: true (secure, can't access via JS)
- secure: true (HTTPS only in production)
- sameSite: lax
- maxAge: 1 year
- path: /
```

This cookie is used by:
- Next.js app for session management
- Streamlit app for tier verification

---
