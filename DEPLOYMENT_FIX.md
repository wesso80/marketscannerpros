# Deployment Configuration Fix

## Problem
The Replit deployment was failing because:
1. `package.json` file in the root directory caused the system to detect this as a Node.js project
2. The deployment attempted to run `npm install` instead of Python setup
3. This conflicted with the actual Python/Streamlit application

## Solution Applied

### Files Moved
The following Next.js/Node.js configuration files were moved from root to `nextjs-web/` subdirectory:
- `package.json` - Node.js dependencies for Next.js web project
- `next.config.mjs` - Next.js configuration  
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `next-env.d.ts` - Next.js TypeScript definitions

### Why This Works
1. **Root directory is now clean** - No `package.json` to confuse deployment detection
2. **Python is correctly identified** - The `.replit` file specifies Python 3.11 as the primary language
3. **Streamlit deployment works** - The run command executes Streamlit correctly on port 5000

### Current Configuration
The `.replit` file is properly configured with:
```
modules = ["python-3.11", "postgresql-16", "nodejs-20", "python3"]
[deployment]
deploymentTarget = "autoscale"
run = ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.port", "5000", "--server.address", "0.0.0.0"]
```

### Python Dependencies
Managed through:
- `pyproject.toml` - Project metadata and dependencies
- `uv.lock` - Lock file for reproducible builds

## Next.js Subproject
The Next.js files in `nextjs-web/` are for the separate marketing/authentication web frontend. They can be used from that directory or temporarily moved back to root for Next.js development (but must be moved back before Streamlit deployment).

## Deployment Status
âœ… **Fixed** - Deployment should now correctly identify this as a Python Streamlit application
