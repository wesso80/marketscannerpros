# Next.js Web Project Files

This directory contains the Next.js/React configuration files for the web marketing site and authentication pages.

## Files
- `package.json` - Node.js dependencies for Next.js web project
- `next.config.mjs` - Next.js configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `next-env.d.ts` - Next.js TypeScript definitions

## Note
These files were moved here from the root directory to prevent deployment conflicts with the main Python Streamlit application. The Streamlit app (`app.py`) is the primary deployment target for this Replit project.

## Development
To work on the Next.js web components, use these files from this directory or move them back to root temporarily (but remember to move them back before deploying the Streamlit app).
